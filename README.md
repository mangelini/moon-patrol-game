You can play either in single mode or with a friend in co-op.  
There are two levels: one with aliens, rocks and holes, and the other with cannons, bombers and aliens.
You can choose between three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, Hard.  
You have three lives to win the game, and your max score will be saved.
